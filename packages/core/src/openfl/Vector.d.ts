		The Vector class lets you access and manipulate a vector — an array whose elements
		all have the same data type. The data type of a Vector's elements is known as the
		Vector's base type. The base type can be any class, including built in classes and
		custom classes. The base type is specified when declaring a Vector variable as well
		as when creating an instance by calling the class constructor.

		As with an Array, you can use the array access operator (`[]`) to set or retrieve the
		value of a Vector element. Several Vector methods also provide mechanisms for
		setting and retrieving element values. These include `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`,
		`unshift()`, and others. The properties and methods of a Vector object are
		similar — in most cases identical — to the properties and methods of an Array. In
		most cases where you would use an Array in which all the elements have the same
		data type, a Vector instance is preferable. However, Vector instances are dense
		arrays, meaning it must have a value (or `null`) in each index. Array instances
		don't have this same restriction.

		The Vector's base type is specified using postfix type parameter syntax. Type
		parameter syntax is a sequence consisting of a dot (`.`), left angle bracket (`<`),
		class name, then a right angle bracket (`>`), as shown in this example:

		In the first line of the example, the variable `v` is declared as a
		Vector.<String> instance. In other words, it represents a Vector (an array) that
		can only hold String instances and from which only String instances can be
		retrieved. The second line constructs an instance of the same Vector type (that is,
		a Vector whose elements are all String objects) and assigns it to `v`.

		```as3
		var v:Vector.<String>;
		v = new Vector.<String>();
		```

		A variable declared with the Vector.<T> data type can only store a Vector instance
		that is constructed with the same base type T. For example, a Vector that's
		constructed by calling `new Vector.<String>()` can't be assigned to a variable that's
		declared with the Vector.<number> data type. The base types must match exactly. For
		example, the following code doesn't compile because the object's base type isn't
		the same as the variable's declared base type (even though Sprite is a subclass of
		DisplayObject):

		```haxe
		// This code doesn't compile even though Sprite is a DisplayObject subclass
		var v:Vector.<DisplayObject> = new Vector.<Sprite>();
		```

		To convert a Vector with base type T to a Vector of a superclass of T, use the
		`Vector()` global function.

		In addition to the data type restriction, the Vector class has other restrictions
		that distinguish it from the Array class:

		* A Vector is a dense array. Unlike an Array, which may have values in indices 0 and 7
		even if there are no values in positions 1 through 6, a Vector must have a value
		(or null) in each index.
		* A Vector can optionally be fixed-length, meaning the number of elements it contains
		can't change.
		* Access to a Vector's elements is bounds-checked. You can never read a value from an
		index greater than the final element (length - 1). You can never set a value with an
		index more than one beyond the current final index (in other words, you can only set
		a value at an existing index or at index [length]).

		As a result of its restrictions, a Vector has three primary benefits over an Array
		instance whose elements are all instances of a single class:

		* Performance: array element access and iteration are much faster when using a
		Vector instance than they are when using an Array.
		* Type safety: in strict mode the compiler can identify data type errors. Examples
		of data type errors include assigning a value of the incorrect data type to a
		Vector or expecting the wrong data type when reading a value from a Vector. Note,
		however, that when using the push() method or unshift() method to add values to a
		Vector, the arguments' data types are not checked at compile time. Instead, they are
		checked at run time.
		* Reliability: runtime range checking (or fixed-length checking) increases
		reliability significantly over Arrays.

			To create a Vector instance from an Array or another Vector (such as one with a

			To create a pre-populated Vector instance, use the following syntax instead of
			using the parameters specified below:

			```as3
			// var v:Vector.<T> = new <T>[E0, ..., En-1 ,];
			// For example:
			var v:Vector.<number> = new <number>[0,1,2,];
			```

			The following information applies to this syntax:

			* It is supported in Flash Professional CS5 and later, Flash Builder 4 and later,
			and Flex 4 and later.
			* The trailing comma is optional.
			* Empty items in the array are not supported; a statement such as
			`var v:Vector.<number> = new <number>[0,,2,]` throws a compiler error.
			* You can't specify a default length for the Vector instance. Instead, the length
			is the same as the number of elements in the initialization list.
			* You can't specify whether the Vector instance has a fixed length. Instead, use
			the fixed property.
			* Data loss or errors can occur if items passed as values don't match the
			specified type. For example:

			```as3
			var v:Vector.<number> = new <number>[4.2]; // compiler error when running in strict mode
			trace(v[0]); //returns 4 when not running in strict mode

			* a function that takes two arguments of the base type (T) of the Vector and
			returns a Number:

				```as3
				function compare(x:T, y:T):Number {}
				```

				The logic of the function is that, given two elements `x` and `y`, the function
				returns one of the following three values:

				* a negative number, if `x` should appear before `y` in the sorted sequence
				* 0, if `x` equals `y`
				* a positive number, if `x` should appear after `y` in the sorted sequence

			* a number which is a bitwise OR of the following values:
				* 1 or `Array.CASEINSENSITIVE`
				* 2 or `Array.DESCENDING`
				* 4 or `Array.UNIQUESORT`
				* 8 or `Array.RETURNINDEXEDARRAY`
				* 16 or `Array.NUMERIC`

				If the value is 0, the sort works in the following way:

				* Sorting is case-sensitive (Z precedes a).
				* Sorting is ascending (a precedes b).
				* The array is modified to reflect the sort order; multiple elements that
				have identical sort fields are placed consecutively in the sorted array in
				no particular order.
				* All elements, regardless of data type, are sorted as if they were strings,
				so 100 precedes 99, because "1" is a lower string value than "9".
