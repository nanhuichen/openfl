/**
	The Capabilities class provides properties that describe the system and
	runtime that are hosting the application. For example, a mobile phone's
	screen might be 100 square pixels, black and white, whereas a PC screen
	might be 1000 square pixels, color. By using the Capabilities class to
	determine what capabilities the client has, you can provide appropriate
	content to as many users as possible. When you know the device's
	capabilities, you can tell the server to send the appropriate SWF files or
	tell the SWF file to alter its presentation.
	However, some capabilities of Adobe AIR are not listed as properties in
	the Capabilities class. They are properties of other classes:

	| Property | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| `NativeApplication.supportsDockIcon` | Whether the operating system supports application doc icons. |
	| `NativeApplication.supportsMenu` | Whether the operating system supports a global application menu bar. |
	| `NativeApplication.supportsSystemTrayIcon` | Whether the operating system supports system tray icons. |
	| `NativeWindow.supportsMenu` | Whether the operating system supports window menus. |
	| `NativeWindow.supportsTransparency` | Whether the operating system supports transparent windows. |

	Do _not_ use `Capabilities.os` or `Capabilities.manufacturer` to determine
	a capability based on the operating system. Basing a capability on the
	operating system is a bad idea, since it can lead to problems if an
	application does not consider all potential target operating systems.
	Instead, use the property corresponding to the capability for which you
	are testing.

	You can send capabilities information, which is stored in the
	`Capabilities.serverString` property as a URL-encoded string, using the
	`GET` or `POST` HTTP method. The following example shows a server string
	for a computer that has MP3 support and 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution and
	that is running Windows XP with an input method editor (IME) installed:
	<pre
	xml:space="preserve">A=t&SA=t&SV=t&EV=t&MP3=t&AE=t&VE=t&ACC=f&PR=t&SP=t&
	SB=f&DEB=t&V=WIN%209%2C0%2C0%2C0&M=Adobe%20Windows&
	R=1600x1200&DP=72&COL=color&AR=1.0&OS=Windows%20XP&
	L=en&PT=External&AVD=f&LFD=f&WD=f&IME=t</pre>
	The following table lists the properties of the Capabilities class and
	corresponding server strings: <adobetable><tgroup

		|`screenResolutionX` | `R` |
		|`screenResolutionY` | `R` |
		|`version` | `V` |


	There is also a `WD` server string that specifies whether windowless mode
	is disabled. Windowless mode can be disabled in Flash Player due to
	incompatibility with the web browser or to a user setting in the mms.cfg
	file. There is no corresponding Capabilities property.

	All properties of the Capabilities class are read-only.

	/**
		Specifies whether the system supports multichannel audio of a specific type. The
		class flash.media.AudioDecoder enumerates the possible types.

		_AIR profile support:_ Multichannel audio is supported only on AIR for TV devices.
		On all other devices, this method always returns `false`. See AIR Profile Support
		for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.

		**Note:** When using one of the DTS audio codecs, scenarios exist in which
		`hasMultiChannelAudio()` returns `true` but the DTS audio is not played. For
		example, consider a Blu-ray player with an S/PDIF output, connected to an old
		amplifier. The old amplifier does not support DTS, but S/PDIF has no protocol to
		notify the Blu-ray player. If the Blu-ray player sends the DTS stream to the old
		amplifier, the user hears nothing. Therefore, as a best practice when using DTS,
		provide a user interface so that the user can indicate if no sound is playing.
		Then, your application can revert to a different codec.

		The following table shows the server string for each multichannel audio type:

		| Multichannel audio type | Server string |
		| --- | --- |
		| AudioDecoder.DOLBY_DIGITAL | DD |
		| AudioDecoder.DOLBY_DIGITAL_PLUS | DDP |
		| AudioDecoder.DTS | DTS |
		| AudioDecoder.DTS_EXPRESS | DTE |
		| AudioDecoder.DTS_HD_HIGH_RESOLUTION_AUDIO | DTH |
		| AudioDecoder.DTS_HD_MASTER_AUDIO | DTM |

		@param	type	A String value representing a multichannel audio type. The valid
		values are the constants defined in flash.media.AudioDecoder.
		@returns	The Boolean value `true` if the system supports the multichannel audio
		type passed in the `type` parameter. Otherwise, the return value is `false`.
