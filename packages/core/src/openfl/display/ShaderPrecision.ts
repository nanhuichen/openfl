/**
	This class defines the constants that represent the possible values for
	the Shader class's `precisionHint` property. Each constant represents one
	of the precision modes for executing shader operations.
	The precision mode selection affects the following shader operations.
	These operations are faster on an Intel processor with the SSE instruction
	set:

	* `sin(x)`
	* `cos(x)`
	* `tan(x)`
	* `asin(x)`
	* `acos(x)`
	* `atan(x)`
	* `atan(x, y)`
	* `exp(x)`
	* `exp2(x)`
	* `log(x)`
	* `log2(x)`
	* `pow(x, y)`
	* `reciprocal(x)`
	* `sqrt(x)`

		work consistently on different platforms and individual CPU

		In full precision mode, the shader computes all math operations to the

		consistent behavior on all platforms. In this mode, some math
		operations such as trigonometric and exponential functions can be
		slow.
